## Breaking Changes

None in this initial release.

## Migration Guide

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. For users migrating from other S3-compatible providers:

1. Update provider configuration to use Backblaze B2 credentials
2. Change bucket references to use `bucket.backblaze.crossplane.io/v1`
3. Update regional endpoint configuration as needed
4. Test S3-compatible applications with new endpoints

## Known Issues

- User and Policy resources not yet implemented
- DeepCopy generation requires manual intervention for complex API tests
- Integration tests require manual Backblaze B2 account setup

## Acknowledgments

This provider builds on the excellent foundation provided by:
- The Crossplane community and runtime
- AWS SDK for Go S3 compatibility layer
- Standard Crossplane provider patterns from sibling providers
- Backblaze B2's S3-compatible API design
